## The Sequence Ontology

Welcome to the Sequence Ontology (SO). SO is a collaborative ontology project for the definition of sequence features used in biological sequence annotation. SO was initially developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium. Contributors to SO include the GMOD community, model organism database groups such as WormBase, FlyBase, Mouse Genome Informatics group, and institutes such as the Sanger Institute and the EBI. Input to SO is welcomed from the sequence annotation community. SO is also part of the Open Biomedical Ontologies library. Our aim is to develop an ontology suitable for describing the features of biological sequences. Further information about SO can be found on the [SO home page](http://www.sequenceontology.org/).

This directory contains the 'source' for the Sequence Ontology. You can view relationships and definitions in a browser format using the [Sequence Ontology browser](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/obob.cgi).

Many different file types are present in this repository and most will contain the same information represented in different formats. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) format file (so.obo) has been used for updating terms and relationships.

Note that we are working to update how we handle issues, so more changes to this repository are coming soon.

### Legacy Files

Some of the files that have been stored on the Sequence Ontology's GitHub repository have not been updated for some time. This includes the files that contain cross product information. While these files have not been updated with the newest information for Sequence Ontology, these files may still be of use to some individuals. These files have moved to the Legacy folder for convenience.
